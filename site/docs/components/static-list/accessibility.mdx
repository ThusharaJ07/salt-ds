## Best practices

You'll need to check and test any focusable elements included in the static list content accordingly.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab / Tab + Shift">

This action navigates through the interactive elements within the static list.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
