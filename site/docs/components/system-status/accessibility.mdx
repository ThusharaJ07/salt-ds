## Best practices

- Use the aria-live="assertive" attribute for error messages to ensure they are announced immediately, interrupting any ongoing speech to alert the user to critical issues requiring immediate attention.

- Use the aria-live="polite" attribute for informational and warning messages, allowing the screen reader to announce these messages at the next available pause, ensuring the user is informed without disrupting their current task.
