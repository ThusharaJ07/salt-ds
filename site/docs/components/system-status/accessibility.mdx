## Best practices

- Use the aria-live="polite" attribute for informational and warning messages, allowing the screen reader to announce these messages at the next available pause, ensuring the user is informed without disrupting their current task.

- When using a system status to alert the user, apply `role="alert"`. When using a system status to notify the user, apply `role="status"`.
